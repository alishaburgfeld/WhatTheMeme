What the Me^^e?!
A hilarious online card/meme game!

Description:

In this game users can log in and either start or join a game. If they start a game they will get a code that they can send to their friends. Once they start a game and indicate they’re ready to start a “Meme Card” will be flipped over in the center of the screen. This will be my first API (https://imgflip.com/api). Users will then draw 6 cards which are generated from my 2nd API (https://rapidapi.com/A-fandino/api/cards-against-humanity/). Users will pick a card that they thing provides the funniest description for the center meme. Once all players have submitted a card the cards will be flipped face up and all players will vote on the funniest meme + caption combination. The owner of that card will receive a point. First player to 7 points wins.
